Pumphouse URP
==============

This repo contains a working version of a URP pipeline pumphouse AR project.

## Files in folder

The unity project is stored in the *unity-pumphouse-urp* folder. 
The *unity-pumphouse-urp* gets added to the Unity Hub.

The unity project files are stored separately so that the repository can contain
other non-unity assets, tools, documentation, and other goodes that might
pollute the unity environment.

## To add to the Unity Hub

1. Clone this repo.  I recommend using *gh* rather than *git*.
1. Open the Unity Hub
1. Select *Open | Add project from disk* and navigate to the *unity-pumphouse-urp* folder.
1. Off you go!

## Branching

Please make any modifications to a branch and when ready, merge the branch back to the main branch.
